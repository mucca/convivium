- Fix overlabel
  - Currently the label only fits if the input is big enough
  - OverLabel.initialize_all not getting called on Ajax form
  - Will it work in search forms?
  - Still need to have Calendar call it somehow and let it know to change the class on the label so that it doesn't display over top of it.

- or get TextFieldWithExample to work
  - Help string seemed like such a good idea but I couldn't figure out how to get Calendar to hide/show the example text and real text box before updating the box so that the proper field was submitted. 
  - Need to figure out how to get a pointer to the input object when it is still a TextFieldWithExample object so that we can call this.removeExample
  - And need to figure out how to call that before, and while still calling Calendar.onSelect
  
- In 2.0 drop support for date_bocks, remove unused-code for date_box
